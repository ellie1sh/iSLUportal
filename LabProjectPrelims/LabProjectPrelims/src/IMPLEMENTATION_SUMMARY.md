# Schedule System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the original Spring Boot course/schedule code with the existing Java Swing Student Portal application. The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while adding comprehensive course and schedule management functionality.

## Components Created

### 1. Core Entity Classes
- **Course.java**: Entity class representing courses with time, room, and scheduling information
- **Student.java**: Extended student entity compatible with existing StudentInfo, adds course enrollment capabilities
- **Enrollment.java**: Relationship entity connecting students to courses with enrollment status tracking

### 2. Data Management Layer
- **CourseDataManager.java**: Extends existing DataManager functionality with course and enrollment operations
  - File-based persistence using pipe-separated format (avoids comma conflicts in course descriptions)
  - Course CRUD operations
  - Student-course enrollment management
  - Query methods for retrieving student schedules

### 3. Business Logic Layer
- **ScheduleService.java**: Service class providing schedule-related business logic
  - Schedule table data generation for GUI display
  - Course conflict detection
  - Schedule summary statistics
  - Time slot management and course placement

### 4. Data Initialization
- **DataInitializer.java**: Populates sample course and enrollment data
  - Creates courses based on original Spring Boot data structure
  - Enrolls sample students in courses
  - Generates additional test data for comprehensive testing

### 5. GUI Integration
- **Updated ISLUStudentPortal.java**: Enhanced existing schedule display
  - Real-time course data integration
  - Enhanced student status display with enrollment information
  - Schedule summary panel with course statistics
  - Improved table formatting and user experience

## Key Features Implemented

### Schedule Display
- **Dynamic Schedule Table**: Real course data displayed in time-slot grid format
- **Course Information**: Shows course codes, rooms, and time ranges
- **Multi-line Support**: Handles course information with room details
- **Schedule Summary**: Displays total courses, units, and daily breakdown

### Data Persistence
- **File-based Storage**: Uses text files for course, enrollment, and student data
- **Pipe-separated Format**: Avoids parsing issues with commas in course descriptions
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of parsing errors and missing data

### Student Management
- **Extended Student Records**: Maintains compatibility with existing StudentInfo while adding course enrollment capabilities
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Student status panel shows current enrollment information
- **Course Enrollment Tracking**: Tracks which courses students are enrolled in

### Course Management
- **Time Conflict Detection**: Identifies scheduling conflicts between courses
- **Day-based Filtering**: Retrieves courses scheduled for specific days
- **Flexible Time Formats**: Handles various time formats and scheduling patterns

## Data Structure

### Course Entity
```
Course {
    id, classCode, courseNumber, courseDescription, units,
    startTime, endTime, days, room
}
```

### Student Entity (Extended)
```
Student {
    id, studentId, fullName, block, academicYear, semester,
    enrollments[], lastName, firstName, middleName, dateOfBirth, password
}
```

### Enrollment Entity
```
Enrollment {
    id, student, course, enrollmentDate, status
}
```

## File Storage Format

### courses.txt
```
id|classCode|courseNumber|courseDescription|units|startTime|endTime|days|room
1|7024|NSTP-CWTS 1|FOUNDATIONS OF SERVICE|3|13:30|14:30|MWF|D906
```

### enrollments.txt
```
id|studentId|courseId|enrollmentDate|status
1|STUDENT123|1|2025-01-01|ENROLLED
```

### studentsExtended.txt
```
id|studentId|lastName|firstName|middleName|fullName|block|academicYear|semester|dateOfBirth|password
1|STUDENT123|RIVERA|SHERLIE|O|SHERLIE O. RIVERA|BSIT 2-3|2025-2026|FIRST SEMESTER|1990-01-01|password123
```

## Sample Data
The implementation includes comprehensive sample data based on the original Spring Boot code:

- **10 Courses**: Including NSTP-CWTS 1, GSTS, GENVI, CFE 103, IT 211, IT 212, IT 212L, IT 213, IT 213L, FIT OA
- **Sample Student**: SHERLIE O. RIVERA (STUDENT123) enrolled in all courses
- **Total Units**: 23 units across all enrolled courses
- **Schedule Coverage**: Courses distributed across Monday-Friday with realistic time slots

## Integration Points

### Existing System Compatibility
- Maintains existing StudentInfo structure and DataManager functionality
- Uses same file resolution and error handling patterns
- Preserves existing GUI layout and navigation structure

### Enhanced Features
- Student status panel now shows enrollment summary and current courses
- Schedule menu displays real course data instead of static information
- Semester display updates dynamically based on student data

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Tests
- **DataInitializer**: Comprehensive data population and verification
- **ScheduleTest**: Validates schedule functionality and data retrieval
- **Compilation**: All classes compile without errors

### Manual Testing
- Schedule GUI displays correctly with real course data
- Student status shows accurate enrollment information
- Data persistence works across application restarts

## Future Enhancements
- Course enrollment/drop functionality through GUI
- Schedule conflict detection and resolution
- Export schedule to PDF or other formats
- Integration with academic calendar and deadlines
- Grade tracking integration with course schedules

## Files Modified/Created
1. **New Files**: Course.java, Student.java, Enrollment.java, CourseDataManager.java, ScheduleService.java, DataInitializer.java, ScheduleTest.java
2. **Modified Files**: ISLUStudentPortal.java (enhanced schedule display and student status)
3. **Data Files**: courses.txt, enrollments.txt, studentsExtended.txt (auto-generated)

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between the original Spring Boot architecture and the existing Java Swing application, providing a robust and user-friendly schedule management system.
