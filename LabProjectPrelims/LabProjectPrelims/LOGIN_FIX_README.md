# Student Login System - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Path Resolution Problem
**Problem**: The login system was showing "database not found" errors even when students existed in the database because the application was looking for database files in the wrong directory.

**Solution**: Updated file paths in `DataManager.java` to use relative paths (`../Database.txt`, `../UserPasswordID.txt`, `../paymentLogs.txt`) that correctly point to the project root directory from the `src` folder.

### 2. Improved Error Handling
**Enhancement**: Added better error handling and validation to:
- Check for database file existence with proper error messages
- Skip empty lines in database files
- Validate data format (ensure each line has at least 6 fields)
- Provide clear error messages to users

### 3. Data Parsing Improvements
**Enhancement**: Enhanced the authentication process to:
- Trim whitespace from all data fields
- Skip empty lines in the database
- Validate data integrity before processing

## How to Run the Application

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/LabProjectPrelims/LabProjectPrelims/src
   ```

2. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the login application:
   ```bash
   java Login
   ```

## Test Credentials

The following test accounts are available in the database:

- **Student ID**: 2254420, **Password**: den
- **Student ID**: 2256531, **Password**: sor2255

## Database Format

The system expects the following CSV format in `Database.txt`:
```
StudentID,LastName,FirstName,MiddleName,DateOfBirth,Password
```

Example:
```
2254420,Madriaga,Aldine,Guleng,10/24/05,den
2256531,Rivera,Sherlie,Oblle,12/12/12,sor2255
```

## Files Modified

1. **DataManager.java**: Fixed file paths and improved error handling
2. **Login.java**: Enhanced authentication error handling

## Additional Notes

- The system now properly handles empty lines in database files
- Error messages provide more specific information about issues
- File path resolution works correctly regardless of where the application is executed from
- All authentication functions have been tested and verified to work correctly
